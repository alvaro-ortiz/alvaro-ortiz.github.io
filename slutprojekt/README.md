#### Description of the project

A static page that fetches data from a JSON-formatted database containing information about upcoming sci-fi movies and uses a bootstrap-enabled carousel to walk the user through them. The data has been arbitrarily collected in accordance with my own taste. There is also a stylized form that will be used in the future to send me an e-mail via a contact form.
